    <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
    <p>
      This steak sandwich recipe is as good as the takeout sub shops of
      Southeastern Massachusetts! I think this is about as close as you can get
      at home. Freezing the steak the day before makes it easy to cut into very
      thin slices.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>¼ medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>4 large fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ green bell pepper, sliced into long strips</li>
      <li>
        1 (1/2 pound) well-marbled beef steak of any type, sliced as thinly as
        possible
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="stpes-list">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion;
        cook and stir until just tender, about 2 minutes. Push onion to sides of
        the pan; add mushrooms and cook until softened. Stir in bell pepper and
        cook just until tender, about 3 minutes. Remove vegetables from the pan
        with a slotted spoon; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the same skillet. Add steak and
        pickled hot peppers; season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper.
        Cook and stir until steak is mostly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
        vegetable mixture back into the pan; stir until heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat; place cheese on top of steak and vegetable mixture so
        it can melt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop mixture into sliced baguette; pour some of the juices on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
